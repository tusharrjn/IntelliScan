## Introduction

INTELLISCAN provides a comprehensive solution for monitoring crowds in various environments. It utilizes computer vision techniques to count the number of people, detect yawning behavior, and monitor posture.

## Features

- *Real-Time People Counting:* Utilizes OpenCV to count the number of people in the camera feed in real-time.
- *Yawn Detection:* Detects if a person is yawning using facial landmark detection and notifies them.
- *Posture Detection:* Utilizes pose estimation to detect the posture of people in the camera feed.

## Requirements

To run INTELLISCAN, you need:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- dlib
